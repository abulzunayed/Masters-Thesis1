# Name of Thesis: Improved Magnetic field mapping based on DREAM MRI and physics informed Neural Network.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) relies on the main static magnetic ϐield (B0) and the
radiofrequency ϐield (B1) for spin polarization and magnetization. The ultrafast Dual
Refocusing Echo Acquisition Mode (DREAM) sequence is proceeded to generate B0 and
B1 maps where it’s able to cover the whole transmit coil volume in only one second, which
is more than an order of magnitude faster than established approaches. This established
technique provides quite promising B0 and B1 maps. However, small signiϐicant
deviations had been addressed in B0 and B1 maps which need to be corrected. Changing
the internal parameters of the sequences is not worthy and simple where the DREAM
sequence provides short acquisition time (a few seconds per slice). Therefore, it is needed
to post-processing of magnetic ϐield maps B0 and B1. Integration of the machine learning
approaches can resolve these implicit challenges. Speciϐically, proposing by two novel
methods: Multiple linear projections model and Artiϐicial neural network model. Both
models minimize the fraction of the B0 and B1 maps simultaneously it is possible to
reduce the divergence in the quality of both maps. After the implementation of both
models in my thesis work, the comparative analysis reveals that Multiple Linear
Projections model yields considerably accurate B0 maps, while Artiϐicial Neural Network
model emerges as a more promising B1 maps due to its marginal computation of data
weights. Eventually, the optimal combination of both models effectively addresses the
divergence in the quality of both B0 and B1 maps and serves as the additional unique
solution for the DREAM sequence.
